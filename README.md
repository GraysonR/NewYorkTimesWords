# NewYorkTimesWords
Scrubs the New York Times and counts the frequency of words.

This is a basic Python script that uses The New York Times API to get all the articles for a day, opens the urls, and scrubs the articles. There is a config.py included so that there is the ability to connect the output of the script to a mySQL database.

#IMPORTANT
I am no longer working on this project because as you go farther back in in time there are less and less active links on The New York Times websites. That means, after about year the true representation of what was said during a day decrease dramatically.
